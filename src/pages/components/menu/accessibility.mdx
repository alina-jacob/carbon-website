No accessibility annotations are needed for menus, but keep these considerations
in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.

## What Carbon provides

Carbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of
blind users and others who operate via keyboard. Carbon also incorporates other
accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.

### Keyboard interaction

The menu is reached by tab. When the menu is open, the first item takes focus.
The menu items are navigated using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys. Pressing
`Space` or `Enter` on a focused menu item activates it and collapses the menu or
activates the sub-menu.

An activated menu item can result in a number of things.

- If it is a link or similar instance, it launches that selection.
- If it is a toggle, it selects or deselects that item.
- Where it is a one of many item, it switches to that item and it shows up as
  selected when the menu is opened again.

  the menu items with focus.

## Development considerations

Keep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a
custom component.

- Each Menu, including nested Menus, are `ul` elements with `role="menu"`
- MenuItems are `li` elements with `role="menuitem"`
- If a MenuItem contains a sub-menu, it is given `aria-haspopup="true"` and
  `aria-expanded` of true or false depending on if the sub-menu is open/visible.
- Selectable Menu Items are given `role="menuitemcheckbox"`
- Menu Item Groups are 'li' elements with `role="group"`
- Menu Item Radio Groups get `role="menuitemradio"`
- Menu items with really long label can get truncated depending on screen sizes.
  This label will be exposed by a browser rendered tooltip on hover or focus.
- Menu implements the
  [menu design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/)
  defined in the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG).
